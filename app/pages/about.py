    st.header("PROJECT DESCRIPTION")
    st.write("""
    In the vast landscape of audio engineering and signal processing, the art of dissecting complex musical compositions 
    into their individual sonic components has witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of music source separation. 
    This cutting-edge technology empowers us to unravel the intricate tapestry of sound, peeling back layers of 
    instruments and vocals from a mixed audio signal. The potential applications of music source separation are 
    far-reaching, spanning the realms of music production, content creation, academic research, and beyond.
    The motivation behind embarking on this music source separation project is rooted in the desire to democratize 
    the creative process, providing musicians, producers, and enthusiasts with a powerful toolset to reshape and 
    reimagine musical compositions. By isolating individual instruments, vocals, and other sound sources, we aim 
    to offer unprecedented control over the auditory experience, fostering creativity and innovation in music 
    production and beyond.
    Our music source separator will not only allow us to separate the vocals, but it will also allow us to separate 
    drums, bass. This will be a bonus to the music directors or enthusiasts to mix up vocals with the drumbeats 
    or the bass or even creating a different version of Karaoke from the original song which will let the end user 
    to try and test and be very innovatively creative.

    st.write("""
    - User can search the song or upload an mp3/mp4/wav file or User can paste a Youtube link to get the song audio.
    - User can see the original audio and separated audio, and user can choose to download any source.
    - Once the original music audio is uploaded, all music sources which are present in the audio will be displayed. 
      For the source separation, source names will be displayed in the four categories: vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments 
      for the uploaded music.
